## Analysis of Stocks
Steve asked for help with an Excel spreadsheet analyzing stocks. His parents were interested in Daqo's stock so we analyzed the data for DQ. After working through DQ, Steve wanted to analyze all stocks so we expanded our analysis to include all stocks in the spreadsheet. We refactored our code in VBA to include all the stocks to determine the yearly return for all stocks in the years of 2017 and 2018.
### Stock Performance and Run Times

### Summary of Analysis
The advantages of refactoring code are that you can review and simplify the code, clean up the code, and improve the readability of the existing code. Refactoring gives you the opportunity to look over the code you currently have and break down the code into simpler terms that run faster and decrease the amount of code required to process your analysis. 
The disadvantages of refactoring code are possible mistakes that can potentially break your code, and you might have to test the funcionality of your code quite often. Testing the functionality of your code aids in making sure your code works, but when refactoring existing code, this can make the task quite tedious when you already have a working code.
The refactoring of the original VBA script of this stock analysis improved the speed of the run time when running the script, however, it also took lots of time and testing to get the refactored code correct to run the same as the original code. 
Overall, the refactoring of the code did improve the analysis of the stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018 by reducing run time while producing the same data results as the original VBA script.
